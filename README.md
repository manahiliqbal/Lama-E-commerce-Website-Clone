# Lama-E-commerce-Website-Clone
As part of my fellowship at Bytewise, I developed a front-end clone of Lama, a popular e-commerce website, using only HTML and CSS. This project involved creating a responsive and visually appealing interface. The clone includes key features such as a dynamic product gallery, user-friendly navigation, and a functional contact form.
